# Chapter 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions

In programming, variables and constants are two of the most important "things"
we use. We declare the variables to be used and specify their types. A
variables' type determines the values it can have and the operations that can be
performed on it. Operators allow us to combine variables (and other things) into
expressions. Expressions produce new values. These are the basic building blocks
of programming.

## 2.1 Variable Names

Variable names must begin with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers,
and underscores. Keep in mind that uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct,
so `x` and `X` are two different variables. Traditionally in C we use lowercase
for variable names and uppercase for symbolic constants.
